# 🛒 Sentiment-Based Recommendation System for E-commerce

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Sentiment-Based Recommendation System** for an e-commerce website that sells a wide variety of products. The dataset contains **user reviews** for products they have purchased/used.  

The objective is to **recommend products** to users based on:  
1. **Sentiment Analysis** of reviews to understand product perception.  
2. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** to suggest products used by similar users.  

This hybrid approach ensures that recommendations are not only based on similarity of usage but also filtered through the lens of customer sentiment, making them more reliable and personalized.

## 🔑 Key Steps  

### 1. Sentiment Prediction Model  
- Collected product reviews as text data.  
- Preprocessed reviews (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).  
- Converted text into numerical representations using **TF-IDF / Word Embeddings**.  
- Trained a **classification model** (Logistic Regression / Naïve Bayes / LSTM, etc.) to predict sentiment (**Positive / Negative / Neutral**).  
- Evaluated performance using metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  

### 2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering  
- Built a **user-product interaction matrix** from historical purchase/review data.  
- Computed similarity between users using **cosine similarity**.  
- For a target user, recommended products highly rated (with positive sentiment) by similar users.  
- Ensured recommendations were sentiment-filtered to avoid suggesting poorly rated products.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data manipulation  
  - `scikit-learn` → ML models, preprocessing, evaluation  
  - `nltk` / `spacy` → Text preprocessing  
  - `surprise` / `scikit-surprise` → Collaborative Filtering  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Visualization

## 📊 Results  
- **Sentiment Model** achieved high accuracy in classifying reviews into positive and negative categories.  
- The **recommendation engine** successfully suggests products that similar users purchased and reviewed positively.  
- Compared to a vanilla collaborative filtering system, the sentiment-enhanced recommender reduced irrelevant/low-rated product recommendations.

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Implement **deep learning models (LSTMs, BERT)** for more accurate sentiment prediction.  
- Extend to **item-based collaborative filtering** or hybrid approaches (user + item).  
- Deploy as a **web application** with APIs for integration into an e-commerce platform.  
- Incorporate **real-time updates** as new reviews are added.
